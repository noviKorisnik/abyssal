# Feature Template

Each feature should:
- Live in its own folder
- Have a public entry point (`index.ts`)
- Include internal logic, not accessed directly by other features
- Optionally provide a feature-specific README

## Example
- Purpose and responsibility
- Public API / entry points
- Example usage
- Any AI guidance
